\usage{
plot_sequential(x, thin = 1, cores = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{"ab"}. Note that the \code{"ab"} object needs
to contain sequential data, that is, the user needs to have provided
cumulative sequences of "successes"/trials.}

\item{thin}{allows the user to skip every \eqn{k}th data point for plotting,
where the number \eqn{k} is specified via \code{thin}. For instance, in
case \code{thin = 2}, only every second element of the data is displayed.}

\item{cores}{number of cores used for the computations.}

\item{...}{further arguments}
}
\description{
Function for plotting the posterior probabilities of the hypotheses
sequentially.
}
\details{
The plot shows the posterior probabilities of the hypotheses as a
  function of the total number of observations across the experimental and
  control group. On top of the plot, probability wheels (see also
  \code{\link{prob_wheel}}) visualize the prior probabilities of the
  hypotheses and the posterior probabilities of the hypotheses after taking
  into account all available data.

  \strong{N.B.: This plot has been designed to look good in the following
  format: In inches, 530 / 72 (width) by 400 / 72 (height); in pixels, 530
  (width) by 400 (height).}
